                </h2>
                <p>I am a motivated and detail-oriented aspiring Front-End Web Developer with a passion for creating visually 
                appealing and user-friendly websites. Seeking a challenging role to leverage my HTML and CSS proficiency, 
                as well as expand my skills in web development. After my last job as a warehouse associate, I realized I 
                needed to take more deliberate control of where my career was heading. I have always had a technical 
                acumen. In addition, I also want to take pride and enjoyment in my work while building impressive projects. 
                After considering the various career paths that the tech industry offers, I figured Front-End Web Dev just might be 
                the best fit for me. Welcome to my survey form project!</p>
